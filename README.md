# Programming problems to keep the mind sharp.
The Computer Science's subjects that can be found here are diversified but always interesting, enjoyable and challenging:

- Data structures: from basic ones like arrays (and variants), linked lists, stacks-queues, graphs and so on, to the advanced data structure like disjoint data sets, fibonacci heaps, etc.

- Algorithms: sorting, recursion and dynamic programming, etc.

- Miscellaneous: all kind of problems that I found enjoyable and challenging to solve.
