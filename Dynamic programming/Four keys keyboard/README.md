# 4 Keys Keyboard

## Problem
In a 4-keys keyboard and a textbox, the only operations that can be performed by these keys are:

1. 'A': Prints one \'A\' on the screen.
2. 'Ctrl-A': Select the whole text of the screen.
3. 'Ctrl-C': Copy the selection to the buffer.
4. 'Ctrl-V': Paste the buffer on the textbox appending it after what is already there.

The four keys can only be pressed for *n* times. You have to find the maximum number of \'A\'s you can print on the textbox (screen).
